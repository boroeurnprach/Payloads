If the application catches database errors when the SQL query is executed and handles them gracefully, there won't be any difference in the application's response. This means the previous technique for inducing conditional errors will not work.

In this situation, it is often possible to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability by triggering time delays depending on whether an injected condition is true or false. As SQL queries are normally processed synchronously by the application, delaying the execution of a SQL query also delays the HTTP response. This allows you to determine the truth of the injected condition based on the time taken to receive the HTTP response.

The techniques for triggering a time delay are specific to the type of database being used. For example, on Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the following to test a condition and trigger a delay depending on whether the expression is true:

```sql
'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'-- 
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
```

- The first of these inputs does not trigger a delay, because the condition `1=2` is false.
- The second input triggers a delay of 10 seconds, because the condition `1=1` is true.
Using this technique, we can retrieve data by testing one character at a time:

```sql
'; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--`
```
