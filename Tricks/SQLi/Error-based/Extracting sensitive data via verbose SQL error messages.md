Misconfiguration of the database sometimes results in verbose error messages. These can provide information that may be useful to an attacker. For example, consider the following error message, which occurs after injecting a single quote into an `id` parameter:
```json
Unterminated string literal started at position 52 in SQL SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = '''. Expected char
```
This shows the full query that the application constructed using our input. We can see that in this case, we're injecting into a single-quoted string inside a `WHERE` statement. This makes it easier to construct a valid query containing a malicious payload. Commenting out the rest of the query would prevent the superfluous single-quote from breaking the syntax.

Occasionally, you may be able to induce the application to generate an error message that contains some of the data that is returned by the query. This effectively turns an otherwise blind SQL injection vulnerability into a visible one.

You can use the `CAST()` function to achieve this. It enables you to convert one data type to another. For example, imagine a query containing the following statement:

`CAST((SELECT example_column FROM example_table) AS int)`

Often, the data that you're trying to read is a string. Attempting to convert this to an incompatible data type, such as an `int`, may cause an error similar to the following:

`ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "Example data"`

This type of query may also be useful if a character limit prevents you from triggering conditional responses.
