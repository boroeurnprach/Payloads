Content Security Policy (CSP) is recognized as a browser technology, primarily aimed at **shielding against attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS)**. It functions by defining and detailing paths and sources from which resources can be securely loaded by the browser. These resources encompass a range of elements such as images, frames, and JavaScript. For instance, a policy might permit the loading and execution of resources from the same domain (self), including inline resources and the execution of string code through functions like `eval`, `setTimeout`, or `setInterval`.
